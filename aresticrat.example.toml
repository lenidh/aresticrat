# General notes:
# - Paths are resolved relative to the working directory of the aresticrat
#   invocation and NOT relative to the config file.
# - Uncommented settings represent default values.
# - Commented out settings represent optional configuration examples.
# - Uppercase values in examples represent user defined names.
#
# Special types:
# - COMMAND: A command consists of a program name followed by any number
#   (including none) of arguments. Values of this type have two possible forms:
#   - a sequence of strings (exec form), e. g. [ "program", "arg1", "arg2" ].
#     These strings are passed to the child process without additional
#     processing.
#   - a string (shell form), e. g. "program arg1 arg2". The string is processed
#     according to parsing rules of a Unix shell.

# The restic executable. Must be a name in PATH or a file path.

# The global forget settings.
# They apply to all locations that do not specify their own backup settings.

# These corresponds to restic options with the same names.

# Must be a sequence of COMMAND values.

### LOCATION SYNTAX ###

# The header defines the location name.
# The name is used to refer to this location from other parts of the
# configuration or the CLI.
#[locations.LOCATION]

# Paths that should be stored in restic repositories (at least one required).
# The key "from" is an alias and may be used instead of "paths".
#paths = [ "/path/to/data" ]

# Repositories that should be used to store the data.
# The key "to" is an alias and may be used instead of "repos".
#repos = [ "REPOSITORY" ]

# Any "options.*" table from above may also be declared for a repository.
# These location-specific sections replace the global sections, meaning that
# none of the global options are applied, even if there are no corresponding
# keys in the location-specific section.
#[locations.LOCATION.options.(backup|forget|...)]
#...


# EXAMPLE: Minimal location configuration.
# - Stores data from a single path.
# - Stores data in a single repository.

#[locations.userhomes]
#paths = [ "/home" ]
#repos = [ "remote" ]


# EXAMPLE: Extensive location configuration.
# - Stores data from multiple paths.
# - Stores data in multiple repositories.
# - Specifies its own forget policy.
# - Specifies what data to exclude.

#[locations.system]
#from = [ "/etc", "/root", "/usr/local", "/var" ]
#to = [ "local", "remote" ]

#[locations.system.options.forget]
#prune = true
#keep-hourly = 48
#keep-daily = 14
#keep-weekly = 4
#keep-monthly = 6
#keep-yearly = 0

#[locations.system.options.backup]

### REPOSITORY SYNTAX ###

# The header defines the repository name.
# The name is used to refer to this repository from other parts of the
# configuration or the CLI.
#[repos.REPOSITORY]

# The path ot this repository. That's the value that would be passed to restics
# -r/--repo option.
#path = "a/restic/repository/path"

# The repository key (password).
#key = "unique_long_secret_value"


# EXAMPLE: Local repository.
#[repos.local]
#path = "/backup/restic-repo"
#key = "secret_local_repo_key"


# EXAMPLE: Remote repository.
#[repos.remote]
#path = "sftp:user@host:/srv/restic-repo"
#key = "secret_sftp_repo_key"
